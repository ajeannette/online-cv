    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Upon graduating with my BA in English Literature with a minor in Medieval Studies, I was hired to fulfill the new role of Open Educational Resource (OER) Publishing Coordinator at Milne Library
      at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Geneseo in partnership with the SUNY OER Services team. This role serviced faculty system-wide, providing them with guidance
      on and production of OER textbooks, primarily in print format. While most OER textbooks are distributed digitally, as OER as a concept is a naturally online initiative, 
      SUNY recognized that there was a need for providing faculty and students with print versions of the online, openly available textbooks at as low a cost as possible.
      I entered this role with some experience in publication design, WordPress, basic HTML and CSS, and distance communication. These skills served me and this position well as they 
      provided a framework for producing clean and accessible textbooks and PDFs.

      In November 2019 I was invited to transition from this role into a fully Geneseo-centric position with the newly founded Center for Digital Learning (CDL)
